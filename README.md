## Goals
Identify my 4 dogs using convolutional neural network (CNN) from 3000+ photos using Keras-based convolutional neural network.

## Dataset

|  Name | Sample photo from the dataset  |
|---|---|
| Aimee | ![Image of Aimee](assets/images/a_02059.jpg_256x256.jpg) |
| Maddie | ![Image of Maddie](assets/images/m_01409.jpg_256x256.jpg) |
| Olivia | ![Image of Olivia](assets/images/o_01106.jpg_256x256.jpg) |
| Pink | ![Image of Pink](assets/images/p_01216.jpg_256x256.jpg) |

## Classification criteria
Criteria for the presence of the dog
For each dog, if one of the eyes and at least a part of the tip of the nose are in the photo, the dog is considered present in the photo and marked as such.

## How each photo in the dataset is marked

<Name prefixes>_<5 digit zero-padded number>.png

| Prefix | Description
|---|---|
| m | Maddie |
| o | Olivia |
| p | Pink |
| a | Aim√©e |

If the photo does not contain any of the dogs above, the file name will be _<5 digit zero-padded number>.png.

Upon data load, this will be converted to a following vector:

| Vector element | Value |
|---|---|
|0|0 or 1.0|
|1|0 or 1.0|
|2|0 or 1.0|
|3|0 or 1.0|
